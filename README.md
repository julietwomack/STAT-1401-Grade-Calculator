# Grade Calculator for STAT 1401

## Introduction
The STAT 1401 Grade Calculator was created for students in Ms. Juliet Womack's sections of STAT 1401 at KSU. The project was inspired by my first semester of teaching and my need to have a quick and accurate way to report to concerned students what their current grade was in my class. The application is flexible enough to allow students to enter in their grades throughout the semester or all at once at the end of the semester. The calculator even takes into consideration:
- Dropping their lowest quiz grade and taking the average of their top 8 quizzes.
- Replacing their lowest unit test grade with their final exam grade if their final exam grade is higher.
- Calculating the final grade for students who are/who are not exempting the final exam
